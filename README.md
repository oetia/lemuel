"Google Chrome" --remote-debugging-port=9222
tsc --watch ts_file.ts

This is going to be me seeing if I can hookup a jupyter notebook with selenium remote debugging to have a massively efficient dev experience.

Being able to maintain state and test code blocks inidividually can save time & sanity.

## ijavascript & chrome-remote-interface work, but are very finicky.

Things that would be nice to have:

-   top level await
-   getting dom objects with javascript instead of strings
-   allowing redefining with const/let/var
